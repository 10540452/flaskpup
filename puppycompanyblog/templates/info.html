  <h1>About Pup.py</h1>
  <p>Pets are part of our everyday lives and part of our families. They provide us with companionship but also with emotional support, reduce
our stress levels, sense of loneliness and help us to increase our social activities and add to a childâ€™s self-esteem and positive emotional
development. In return, as responsible pet owners we need to ensure that our animals are kept healthy, fit, get nutritious food, love and
affection and proper housing and care.</p>
    <p>Dogs have not always held a special place in the hearts of their human companions.
        Their role among humans was mostly utilitarian until the 18th century, when the term "man's best friend"
        came into the lexicon. Their working roles are reduced today, but their importance at home has only increased.
        From pets to sporting companions to service dogs, canines add a measurable degree of quality to the worlds of
        the humans they share their lives with.</p>
    <strong><p>This Portal is dedicated to the best companion in the world.</p></strong>
